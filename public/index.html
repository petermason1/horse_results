<td style="white-space: nowrap;">9yo who has been beaten on his last 20 starts going back to August 2023 but he frequently runs well and has finished second at Newmarket the last twice (bumped into much improved winner when beaten 6l last time); didn't enjoy a clear run when fair seventh in this last year; has an each-way shout.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Back after a gelding operation when runner-up on handicap debut at Beverley (1m2f, good) in April; was beaten 5l in that race and was similar story at Newbury (fourth of 14) next time but he's still unexposed and has shaped as though this new trip could suit; possibilities.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Held at 100-30 or shorter in his four runs, with his best effort a second at Catterick (1m4f maiden) on his penultimate run in April; didn't fire at Kempton last month but it's still early days and he needs a close look on this switch to a handicap; cheekpieces added.</td>

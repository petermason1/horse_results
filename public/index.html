<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Talented sprinter; ran to high level at York last month; 6f on slow ground may stretch him</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Not at his best on AW on his first two starts of the season but he ran as well as he ever has when third of 16 at York's Dante meeting three weeks ago (6f, good to firm); fully effective on slower ground but the combination of 6f and rain-softened ground might just see his stamina ebb away.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Hasn't won since 2022; off 322 days; market check for yard debut after 3,400gns sale</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Four-time Flat winner in low-grade AW handicaps (1m6f-2m, three in a hood) but the last of them was in late 2022 and there's been a steady decline since; pulled hard when well held over hurdles last July on latest outing; left Derek Shaw for 3,400gns in January; returning hood makes its first appearance for well over two years and he's worth a market check on this stable debut.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Lightly raced but he won his second and third handicaps, around 1m6f at Wolverhampton and Chelmsford last January; beaten just over 9l on comeback at Wolverhampton (about 2m) last month but he went through the race encouragingly; that was his first start for 466 days and he's entitled to be sharper this time.</td>

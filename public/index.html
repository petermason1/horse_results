<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Better is needed but she looked promising with her Listed 2nd at York (1m, good to firm)</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">The only 3yo in this field and she's had just four starts; made all at Kempton (7f, AW) last October and runner-up in the other three, most recently on turf debut when coming strongly from the rear in nine-runner 3yo Listed race at York (1m, good to firm) while the winner raced on the other side; better is needed but she looks promising.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Three wins already last term before she proved a revelation in Listed race at Ascot (7f, soft) in October, gamely making most to score on her first run on ground softer than good; has left William Haggas (same owners); more to prove at about 1m (third go today) and further marked improvement is needed.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Ridden by Laura Pearson for over two years now; 11-22 overall, often front-runner; it took until October before she really found her stride last season but she then won two Listed races at Saint-Cloud and one at Nottingham, all at about 1m in the mud; 2025 return (Saint-Cloud) wasn't great, so she's been well held since last July in all three of her Group races, but the Listed form suggests she is well capable of winning at this level.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Versatile tactically; took her form to a new level in 2024, which included a Listed win at Newmarket (1m, heavy) in September and some solid runs in Group races to start the season; close fourth from the front at Goodwood on reappearance five weeks ago and has each-way claims.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Stacks went wrong for her in this race last year (good to soft; acts on heavy) but she renewed her effort in fine style to go down by a neck in that bunched finish; however, all four starts since have been a major struggle and she was given wind surgery after final run last term; tongue tied this season and also sports cheekpieces in this revival bid.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">On a competitive mark, promising this year and Oisin Murphy is a notable jockey booking</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Strong form when winning a 5f handicap at Haydock last summer (good ground) and he ran to a similar level twice afterwards, including a fine second on soft ground at Doncaster in October; two promising efforts this year, making some stealthy late progress at Chester's May meeting on latest outing; the eye is drawn to the booking of Oisin Murphy, who was on board for his near-miss at Doncaster; a big run is on the cards.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">On the up at present but being 5lb out of the weights might prove insurmountable</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Comes here on the up, winning two of his last four starts and running as well as he ever has when third at Chelmsford on Sunday; 5lb out of the weights here, though, and that could prove beyond him.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Dominant display over C&D in April; only midfield at York latest; significant rain a query</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Positives include his relatively low mileage and the fact that he produced his best performance over this C&D in April when cheekpieces were tried for the first time; on the downside, he's 7lb higher, he was well held at York last month and he would have more to prove if the going is slower than good.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Admirable sprinter and banging at the door in 2025; the track looked an issue in one visit</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Durable sprinter who has been better than ever this year, placed in good sprints at Musselburgh and twice at York; hasn't got much wiggle room off his current mark, however, and although he ran well in form terms when fourth in the 3yo Dash here in 2023, he looked all at sea on the track in the closing stages; other options are perhaps stronger this time.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Progressive in 2024 before refusing to race at Goodwood; should leave reappearance behind</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Has been headstrong but he was getting the hang of things in 2024, winning 5f handicaps at Goodwood and Ascot (both on good ground, handles slower); refused to race at Goodwood last July which does sound a note of caution but there were no issues at the start at Chester on his return, a race in which he was dropped in from a wide stall and never threatened; surprising if he weren't seen to much better effect today.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Losing run stands at 40 but he has the talent to play a major role</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Hugely talented sprinter who has run a string of fine races in defeat this year, including when second to Spartan Arrow over C&D in April (met traffic); he's sneaking back up the weights and his losing run stands at 40 but it would be no surprise to see him in the shake-up.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">In good form in Bahrain for new yard; has the rail draw; significant rain would be a query</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Ex-Andrew Balding; inconsistent last year but smart on his day, notably when winning a 6f handicap at Newmarket's Guineas meeting; in good form in Bahrain this year, most recently showing plenty of pluck to win a local Grade 1 (5f, good) in March; returns to Britain with an inflated mark but he's drawn against the rail and has the pace to capitalise; significant rain would be a query.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Blew hot and cold in 2023 and 2024 but he's been a model of consistency for his new yard in 2025, winning twice on AW and turning in solid efforts back on turf the last twice; his trainer, who is mob-handed, may have stronger claims elsewhere, though.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Classy sprinter, third in this race in 2023; good form in 2025; can blow the start</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Capable of smart form on turf and AW and he looked to have this race in safekeeping in 2023, only to be worn down close home; temperamental issues surfaced last summer, however, blowing the start in this race and on a couple of subsequent occasions; returned from five months off to win a Southwell Listed race in February and backed that up with a good third in the Group 3 Palace House Stakes five weeks ago; today's greater emphasis on speed is in his favour but he probably wouldn't want much rain.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">An easy 5f on slow ground is ideal; clear promise the last twice; interesting</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">The winner of nine races, seeming particularly well suited by an easy 5f on slow ground; he has looked to be running himself into top form this year, travelling better than anything when sixth of 17 at York's Dante meeting (5f, good to firm); not at his best in this race in 2023 but fast ground wouldn't have been ideal; every drop of rain to fall will be in his favour and his rider's claim is a bonus; should be arriving on the scene late.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Made all in the 2022 Dash; high in weights after win last September; rain not ideal</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Has been to Epsom only once before and that resulted in a gutsy front-running success in this race in 2022; as good as ever last year, notably when winning a four-runner conditions event at Beverley; the handicapper took a dim view of that win and he's struggled since but he is more realistically weighted again now; has form on good to soft but peak efforts on good or quicker.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Out of half-sister to top-class miler Rock Of Gibraltar; upgraded his 2yo form when dealing with heavy ground to beat Green Storm in a three-runner race for Group 1 Criterium de Saint-Cloud (1m2f) in October; the race looked to be needed when he was beaten nearly 7l by Delacroix in a Group 3 at Leopardstown (1m2f, good) last month but that's quite a gap to bridge.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">0-5 for Cormac Farrell but at least signed off with her best form effort at Thurles in March (2m4f, good to yielding); very interesting considering the dam enjoyed a galloping 2m4f-plus, and her new yard continues in fine form; hood added.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Both wins on AW towards the end of 2024, one over 1m4f; consistent through the winter and recent turf runs have come behind winners who were ahead of their marks; cheekpieces haven't done much for him in the past, though.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Modest hurdle form through the winter but he had shown AW promise for previous yard and he lost out close home back on turf at Leicester (1m2f, good to firm) in May; the quickish return didn't work out at Windsor since but he may do better with a longer break this time.</td>

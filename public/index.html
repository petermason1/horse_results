<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Fell on chase debut here one week ago and he wasn't looking the likely winner at the time</td>
<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Won over hurdles at Fontwell (3m2f, good) in April 2023 and was a close second at Ludlow (2m5f, good) two months ago; however, he'd dropped to the rear when falling on last week's chase debut here (2m5f, good); Illogical Logic was skipping along merrily in the lead at the time so he probably has work to do.</td>

<td style="white-space: nowrap;">Has had only five races; C&D novice winner (good to soft) last July on second outing; she's not improved on that form in her three handicaps (all about 1m4f) and latest was a heavy defeat, but absent 203 days since and it's possible she can return refreshed.</td>
